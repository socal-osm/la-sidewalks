# la-sidewalks
Los Angeles city doesn't have a sidewalks shapefile, adding the data to OSM could prove useful for analysis of pedestrian accidents and trouble-intersections.

Example: [Downtown sidewalks in Overpass Turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/h5y)

Mark Greninger at the county says that Los Angeles is already working on this. It may be wasteful to try and duplicate that work. But, there could still be some interest in adding crosswalks, especially new ones that are blind-friendly. I've noticed the city installing these lately.

## Possible next steps
1. Contact city and see if they have crosswalk replacement data (with coordinates)
2. Wait for city to create sidewalk file
